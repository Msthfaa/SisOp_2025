# Operating System Workflow from Boot to Shutdown

## Flowchart Explanation
This flowchart illustrates the working process of an operating system (OS) from powering on the laptop to shutting it down.

### **1. Start**
The process begins when the laptop is turned on.

### **2. Power Button Pressed**
The user presses the power button to initiate the boot sequence.

### **3. Boot Loader**
The system loads the bootloader, a small program responsible for starting the OS.

### **4. Loads OS Kernel**
The bootloader loads the OS kernel into the system memory (RAM) to initialize the operating system.

### **5. OS Running?**
The system checks whether the OS is running properly:
   - **Yes:** The OS is successfully loaded, allowing user interaction.
   - **No:** If the OS fails to start, the system remains in a hardware operation mode to handle potential errors or perform recovery processes.

### **6. User Interaction**
If the OS is running, the user can interact with the system, open applications, and perform various tasks.

### **7. Shut Down?**
The system checks if the user initiates a shutdown command:
   - **Yes:** The OS proceeds with the shutdown process.
   - **No:** The system continues running, allowing further user interaction.

### **8. OS Shutdown**
The OS begins shutting down by terminating processes, closing applications, and safely turning off system components.

### **9. End**
The laptop completely powers off, marking the end of the process.
